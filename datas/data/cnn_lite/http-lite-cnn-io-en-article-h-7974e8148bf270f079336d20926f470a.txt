(CNN) - Kelly Clarkson's kids made a splash in their debut interview with "Aquaman" star Jason Momoa. In a recent episode of "The Kelly Clarkson Show," the singer brought her two children, son Remington Blackstock and look-a-like daughter River Blackstock, on stage to interview one of their favorite DC superheroes. Momoa, a father himself, faced hard-hitting questions, like whether Aquaman knows Ariel from "The Little Mermaid" and where the sea-based hero goes to the bathroom. Yes, Ariel's very sweet; she's very nice," Momoa said, playing along. "She's also a redhead," he said, addressing Remy. "I'm gonna teach you about redheads some day. They're very passionate, very passionate people." The comment earned a laugh from Clarkson and the crowd. Momoa can currently be seen in the Apple TV+ series "See." "The Kelly Clarkson Show" airs weekdays in syndication. Â© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage).
