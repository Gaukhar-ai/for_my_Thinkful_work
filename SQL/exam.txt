--1 Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.

select column_name, data_type
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'naep';


--2 Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.

select *
from naep
limit 50;

--3. Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. 
--Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.

select state,    
			round(avg(avg_math_4_score), 0) as score_avg,
                                                                round(sum(avg_math_4_score), 0) as sum_avg,
			max(avg_math_4_score) as max_score,
			min(avg_math_4_score) as min_score
from naep
group by state
order by state asc; 

--4. Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the summary 
--statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max and min values that
--are greater than 30.

select  state, 
			 round(avg(avg_math_4_score), 0) as score_avg,
                                                                 round(sum(avg_math_4_score), 0) as sum_avg,
			max(avg_math_4_score) as max_score,
			min(avg_math_4_score) as min_score
from naep			
group by state
having max(avg_math_4_score) - min(avg_math_4_score > 30
order by state;
								   
--5. Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states. 
--This field should list the states in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.	
	
select state, avg_math_4_score
from naep
where year = 2000 and avg_math_4_score is not NULL	
order by avg_math_4_score
limit 10;

--6 Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score,
--rounded to the nearest two decimal places, over all states in the year 2000.	
	
select round(avg(avg_math_4_score),0)			
from naep
where year = 2000;
								   
--7Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000. 
--This field should list all states with an avg_math_4_score less than 
--the average over all states in the year 2000.		
								   
select state below_average_states_y2000 
from naep 
where avg_math_4_score < ( 
	   select
	   round(avg(avg_math_4_score), 0) avg_math4_2000 
	   from naep 
	   where year = 2000) 
and year = 2000;
						
--8.Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that
--lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of
--the naep table for the year 2000.
		
select state scores_missing_y2000, avg_math_4_score 
from naep 
where avg_math_4_score is NULL 
and year = 2000;
								   
9. --Write a query that returns, for the year 2000, the state, avg_math_4_score,
--and total_expenditure from the naep table, joined using the LEFT OUTER JOIN
--clause with the finance table. Use id as the key and order the output by total_expenditure
--from greatest to least. Make sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest two decimal places, 
--and then filter out NULL values in avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.		
						   
select naep.state,
 round (avg_math_4_score, 2) avg_math_4_2000, total_expenditure 
from naep left outer join finance fin 
on naep.id = fin.id 
where avg_math_4_score is not null and naep.year = 2000 
order by total_expenditure desc;
