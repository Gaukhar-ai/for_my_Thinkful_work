Where a company is delisted and the ticker is recycled; we utilise that ticker for the currently active company and append a number to the ticker of the delisted company. For example GM represents the current actively traded General Motors entity; and GM1 represents the entity that filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Where we have identified that multiple classes of shares exist for a company; we include the alternative share classes in the Related Tickers field of the ticker listing.

We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018-07-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28. A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018-09-30 and 2018-06-30 respectively. However, we assign these both to the 2018-06-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability of this period."
